# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

The project structure is taken directly from the [Nuxt 3 guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt) and this template streamlines the set up process.

There is additional documentation in the project files (.vue,.js,.ts)
